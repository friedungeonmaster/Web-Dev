        <h1>Travel to Japan</h1>
        
        <p> <strong>Japan</strong> is the first country to greet the dawn. But the main feature of the land of the rising sun are its inhabitants. Who else on the planet admires cherry blossoms so much, being able to build trains rushing at the speed of light? </p>
