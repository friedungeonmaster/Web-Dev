    <h1> Lyrics</h1>
    <p> She showed me fake love, can't forget <br>
        How it hurt, no, oh-oh <br>
        Made a list of my regrets <br>
        And you were the first, love, oh-oh <br>
        Oh it hurts, I can't forget <br>
        How it hurt, no, oh-oh <br>
        Made a list of my regrets. <br>
    </p>
